## How to file issues and get help

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.

### Filing Issues

We have specific issue templates to help you provide the right information:

- **[Bug Report](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/issues/new?template=bug-report.md)** - Report something that isn't working correctly
- **[Feature Request](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)** - Suggest a new feature or enhancement
- **[General Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/issues)** - File any other type of issue or browse existing issues

Please ensure that you are not filing a duplicate issue by searching existing issues first.

Our team actively monitors and manages  issues in this repository.

- **Bug Reports and questions**: Critical bugs are prioritized and addressed as quickly as possible. Questions will be monitored.

### When a New Issue is Created

All new issues are automatically reviewed and tagged with appropriate labels:

- **Framework/language**: `dotnet`, `electron`, `javascript`, `python`, `gui` (based on the affected area)
- **Priority**: `good first issue`, `help wanted` (for community contribution opportunities)

### Investigation

As we investigate and work on issues, additional labels are applied:

- **`known-issue`** - Applied to issues the team has identified and is tracking
- **`needs:docs`** - Issues that require documentation updates or clarification
- **`dependencies`** - Issues related to external dependency updates

### Closing Issues

When closing issues, we apply final classification labels:

- **`duplicate`** - Issue already reported elsewhere (includes link to original)
- **`invalid`** - Issue doesn't seem right or cannot be reproduced
- **`wontfix`** - Issue will not be addressed (with explanation in comments)
